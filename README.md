## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites for Deployment

- Vercel account
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Firebase project configured
- Stripe account in test mode
- Environment variables ready

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.local`
   - Redeploy if needed

4. **Add Domain to Firebase**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
   - Add your Vercel domain to Authorized domains

### Backend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Create `vercel.json`**

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "index.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd ClubSphere-Server

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add all variables from `.env` in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

4. **Update Client API URL**
   - Update `VITE_API_URL` in client to point to deployed server
   - Redeploy client

### Post-Deployment Checklist

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: CORS Error
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Server: Ensure CORS is properly configured
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://club-sphere-client-five.vercel.app'
  ],
  credentials: true
};
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

#### Issue: Authentication Persists After Logout
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Clear localStorage and sessionStorage on logout
localStorage.removeItem('token');
sessionStorage.clear();
```

#### Issue: 404 on Page Reload (React Router)
**Solution:**
```json
// Add _redirects file in public folder
/* /index.html 200
```

#### Issue: Firebase Token Verification Fails
**Solution:**
- Check Firebase Admin SDK credentials
- Ensure token is sent in Authorization header
- Verify token hasn't expired

#### Issue: Stripe Payment Not Working
**Solution:**
- Check Stripe public and secret keys
- Ensure using test mode keys
- Verify webhook configuration

#### Issue: MongoDB Connection Timeout
**Solution:**
- Whitelist IP address in MongoDB Atlas (0.0.0.0/0)
- Check connection string format
